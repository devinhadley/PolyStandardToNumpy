# PolyStandardToNumpy
<small> Converts a polynomial written in standard form via a string, into a NumPy 1D polynomial </small>
<hr>
<h3> Installation </h3>
<p> Simply copy and paste the contents from polyFormConversion.py into a file, then import the getNumpy1D function. There are other functions within the code, but you will most likely have no reason to use them.</p>
<p> Also ensure you have numpy installed as getNumpy1D returns a numpy poly1d.</p>

<hr>
<h3> Formatting </h3>
<p><strong>It is essential that you follow the formatting rules!</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Polynomials need to be ordered from greatest degree to lowest degree per standard convention.</li>
	<li>Exponets are written using ^. Ex: x^5+x</li>
	<li>No spaces.</li>
  <li>x's should be lowercase.</li>
</ol>

<h3> Any Issues? </h3>
<p> There may be circumstances that I havent come across or have yet to think of. If you have any issues with the code, feel free to leave an issue and I will fix it ASAP. </p>
